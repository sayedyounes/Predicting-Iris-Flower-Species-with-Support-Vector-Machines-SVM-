# Predicting-Iris-Flower-Species-with-Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
I recently completed a machine learning project using the classic Iris dataset, where I applied Support Vector Classification (SVC) to accurately classify flower species based on their physical features.  üîç Project Overview: This project walks through the full machine learning pipeline‚Äîfrom data exploration to model evaluation‚Äîusing Python.
